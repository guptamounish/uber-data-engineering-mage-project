# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

## Introduction
This project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as mage.AI, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Google Cloud Storage to develop a comprehensive data analytics platform tailored for Uber's operational data. By integrating these advanced tools, the project aims to enhance data processing efficiencies, enable deeper analytical insights, and support data-driven decision-making across Uberâ€™s various service domains. This modern data engineering initiative on Google Cloud Platform represents a strategic effort to harness the full potential of big data in the transportation industry.

## Data set used:
TLC Trip Record Data
Yellow and Green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

Here is the dataset I used: https://github.com/guptamounish/uber-data-engineering-mage-project/blob/main/data/uber_data.csv
